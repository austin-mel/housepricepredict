# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create the best-performing neural network and report its performance metrics. Additionally, since this is a regression problem, a life chart and RMSE score of the best model should be provided to further assess the performance of the model.

This project aims to help us develop familiarity with the TensorFlow functional API as well as deepen our understanding of modeling CNNs and FCNNs for regression problems. Additionally, this project shows us how to concatenate two different models to obtain a single output prediction.
